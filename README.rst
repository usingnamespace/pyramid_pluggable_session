pyramid_pluggable_session
=========================

Want to be able to change out session backends using a simple configuration
change, want to store your session data in a new location but re-implementing
ISession from Pyramid looks too daunting, fear not, pyramid_pluggable_session
makes this really simple.

Is this a pyramid_beaker replacement?
=====================================

Yes. Although I've already been told that unless I implement ALL existing
beaker backends that I am not doing it right, so I am hereby doing it wrong
;-).
